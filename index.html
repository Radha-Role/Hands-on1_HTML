    <p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via
        cryptographic hashes.<b><sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup></b>Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous
        block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
        represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a
        chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
        Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given
        block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation<strong> "Computer
            Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.</strong>"<sup>[10]</sup>Further
        work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in<sub>1991</sub> by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
        Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered

    <p> In<sub> 1992,</sub> Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved
        its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sub>[4][12]</sub>sub
        Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every
        week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup></p>

    <p><em><ins>Ethereum</ins></em> is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology. It is
        most commonly known by investors for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), and by developers for its use in
        blockchain and decentralized finance application development.

        Anyone can use Ethereum—it's designed to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized—to create any
        secured digital technology. Its token is designed to pay for work done supporting the blockchain, but
        participants can also use it to pay for tangible goods and services if accepted.</p>
